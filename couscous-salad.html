  <h3>a Yummy Salmon Couscous Salad</h3>
  <p>This salmon couscous salad recipe features salmon, couscous, and arugula salad layered in a bowl and drizzled with
    homemade pesto dressing for a unique presentation. This dish is a nod to a dish I tried at a local restaurant.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p> <strong>Dressing:</strong>

    1/2 cup mayonnaise

    1/2 cup buttermilk

    1/4 cup prepared pesto

    1 lemon, juiced

    1 clove garlic

    ground black pepper to taste

    <strong>Couscous:</strong>

    1 (5.8 ounce) package herb and garlic couscous

    Salmon:

    1/2 pound salmon filet, with skin

    1 teaspoon Greek seasoning, such as Cavender’s® Greek Seasoning

    1 teaspoon butter

    1 teaspoon olive oil

    <strong>Salad:</strong>

    2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped

    2 cups arugula and spinach salad mix, roughly chopped

    2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese

    2 tablespoons pepitas
  </p>

  <h2>Directions</h2>

 <span><strong>Step 1</strong></span> 
 <p>Add mayonnaise, buttermilk, pesto, lemon juice, and garlic to the bowl of a food processor. Blend until smooth. Season
to taste with black pepper. Set dressing aside.</p>
<span><strong>Step 2</strong></span>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Season salmon with Greek seasoning. Cut salmon into two filets. Melt
butter in a skillet over medium heat and add olive oil. Place salmon, skin side down, in the hot skillet. Cook until
salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 8 minutes.</p>
<span><strong>Step 3</strong></span> 
<p>Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir couscous into the water. Cover saucepan and let stand
until water is absorbed completely, about 10 minutes.</p>

<span><strong>Step 4</strong></span> 
<p>To assemble, place salad mixture into 2 dinner bowls, and sprinkle chopped tomatoes over the salad. Fluff couscous with
a fork. Mound couscous in the center of each bowl. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese around couscous. Place a salmon filet to the
side of the couscous. Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons pesto dressing on top of dish. Sprinkle with pepitas. Serve immediately.</p>
