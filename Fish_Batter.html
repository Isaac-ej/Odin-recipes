  <h3>Unbelievable Fish Batter</h3>
  <p>This fish batter recipe makes the lightest, crispiest batter imaginable! I received this recipe on a talk radio show in
  the early 1950s. It makes enough to coat approximately 2 pounds of fish.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <p>1 cup all-purpose flour
  
  ½ cup milk
  
  ½ cup water
  
  ¼ teaspoon baking powder
  
  1 teaspoon salt</p>

  <h4>Directions</h4>

  <p>
    <span><strong>Step 1</strong></span>
    Whisk flour, milk, water, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl until smooth.

    <span><strong>To Use</strong></span>
    Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Dip fish fillets into the batter to coat. Carefully lower
    fillets, one at a time, into the hot oil. Fry several fillets at a time, turning once, until cooked through and golden
    brown, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
