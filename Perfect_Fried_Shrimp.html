   <h3>Perfect Fried Shrimp</h3>
   <p>There truly is nothing better than a crispy, crunchy batch of fried shrimp. This easy, no-fuss recipe is perfect when
  that salty craving hits. Serve these lil' poppers in a po' boy or taco, or just enjoy them straight up with lemon
  wedges, cocktail sauce, and rémoulade.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <p>3 cups canola oil, or as needed
  
  2 large eggs, beaten
  
  1 cup whole milk
  
  2 tablespoons chile hot sauce (such as Cholula®)
  
  2 pounds large peeled, deveined raw shrimp
  
  3/4 cup all-purpose flour
  
  2/3 cup cornmeal
  
  1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
  
  1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  
  1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</p>

  <h4>Instructions</h4>

  Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large deep skillet; heat over medium-high to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C).
  
  Whisk together eggs, milk, and hot sauce in a shallow dish; add shrimp to mixture, and toss to coat. Whisk together
  flour, cornmeal, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a separate shallow dish.
  
  Remove 6 to 8 shrimp from egg mixture, shaking excess off; dredge in flour mixture. Place dredged shrimp in hot oil; fry
  until coating is golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet lined with paper
  towels. Repeat with remaining shrimp, bringing oil back to 370 degrees F(185 degrees C) over medium-high heat before
  adding each batch of shrimp.
